    "We went through a few ideas before we settled on our topic. We always had recreational activities in mind, but we wanted to make this project interesting. We went from best neighborhoods for recreational activities, to best places to party, to best places for parkour, to best places to meet an alien. We asked ourselves what we would look for in a neighborhood when visiting a new city. We used a few metrics to determine the best neighborhood from publicly available datasets. "

    "We wanted to focus on playgrounds and green spaces, but it turned out that focusing on courts/rinks was easier than analyzing land area and location. We thought adding public art into the mix would be useful since we want to communicate to this alien the values of humanity through artistic expression. This expression can not only communicate human emotion, but also human events.\n",
